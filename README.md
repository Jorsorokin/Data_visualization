# Data_visualization
various functions for data visulization (mostly centered around neuroscience)

These are functions I've been building in a research setting, and are mostly geared towards neuroscientists.
These tools are primarily for visualization only. Currently only matlab functions are available, but Julia and Python functions
will soon be added as well.
